                If you're already logged in, double check that the username and <strong>last four characters</strong> at the top of <a href="{{ route('home') }}">the homepage</a> match your username and <strong>last four characters</strong> in your Discord client. It's pretty common for people to accidentally be logged into a different Discord account in their browser and not even know it!
            </p>
            <p>
                If the username and/or last four characters on the homepage <strong>don't match</strong> your account in your Discord client, visit Discord's website and log out. Log back in to Discord, and make sure it gives you the right account. Log out of {{ env('APP_NAME') }} and back in, and you should be all set!
            </p>

                Still not working? Ask for help <a href="{{ env('APP_DISCORD') }}" target="_blank">on our Discord</a>.

            <h2 id="how-to-loot-council">How do I loot council?</h2>
            <p>
                We're glad you asked. This is the most comprehensive guide we could find: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/hnjsge/how_to_loot_council/" target="_none">How To Loot Council</a>

            <p>
                We aim to give loot councils an easy way to fairly distribute loot by providing them with the necessary information for them to make their decisions. At a glance, you can see which members are going for which items, what loot they've received in the past, any notes they may have, and all packaged in a clean and easy to read interface.
            </p>
            <p>
                For raiders, you can clearly and easily communicate to loot council and fellow raiders what loot you're going for, making it much harder to be accidentally overlooked. You can even use our system to identify loot that the rest of your raid may have overlooked, giving you an edge in snagging some extra gear!
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have any questions or would like to help out, please reach out to us <a href="{{ env('APP_DISCORD') }}" target="_blank">on our Discord</a>.

            <h2 id="getting-started">How do I get started?</h2>
            <p>
                Start by <a href="{{ route('guild.showRegister') }}">registering your guild's Discord server</a>, which requires you have Administrator permissions on your Discord server. Fill out the basic guild settings in the admin section once registered.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you've done this preparation, you can then share the link to your guild's page with your guild members who are on your guild Discord server. Provided they have one of the allowed roles (if specified any in your guild settings), they will be able to join your guild's page.
            </p>

            <hr class="light">

            <h2 id="discord-requirement">Do I <em>need</em> to use Discord?</h2>
            <p>
                Yes. We designed this website to work with our guild and other major guilds on our server. We all use Discord, so we designed this website around our needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                We suggest you have a Discord server for your guild. We also suggest you create roles on your Discord server which you then assign to your guild members (roles such as 'Guild Master', 'Officer', 'Class Leader', 'Raider', 'Member'). These roles can then be imported onto this website and be used to define who has access to what (ie. a Raid Leader can assign loot to a raider, but a standard Member cannot).
            </p>

            <hr class="light">

            <h2 id="privacy">What information do you collect?</h2>
            <p>
                TL;DR Your Discord username, ID, avatar ID, and roles for any servers you register/join. Since this project is open source, you can review the data we collect <a href="https://github.com/thatsmybis/thatsmybis/blob/master/app/Http/Controllers/Auth/LoginController.php#L91" target="_blank">right here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/thatsmybis/thatsmybis/blob/master/app/Http/Controllers/Auth/LoginController.php#L45" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your username and ID are so we can verify it's you when you're logging in. Roles are so we can give you the proper permissions in your guild if you're a raider, raid leader, officer, or guild master.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of the available Discord <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#shared-resources-oauth2-scopes" target="_blank">OAuth2 Scopes</a> (info you allow Discord to share with us when you register or sign in), we're only using 'identify' and 'guilds'. Guilds scope data isn't stored anywhere; it's only used to (a) identify which guilds are registered on the system that you belong to, and (b) provide a dropdown of available servers when a guild master is registering a guild.
            </p>
            <p>
                We're also using Google Analytics to keep track of how the site is doing. Firefox has built-in features to block Google Analytics, which should be enabled by default. (however, I somehow doubt Google Chrome does the same...)

            <h2 id="google-calendar">Google Calendar?</h2>
            <p>
                You can create a Google Calendar and share a link to its public URL in the guild settings page. {{ env('APP_NAME') }} will then give your guild members access to a page that shows this calendar.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>If the calendar isn't working</strong>, follow <a href="https://i.imgur.com/IrhWvj7.png" target="_blank">these instructions</a>. <small>(in Google Calendar 1&gt; Calendar settings 2&gt; Settings for my calendars 3&gt; Choose your calendar 4&gt; Integrate calendar 5&gt; Public URL to this calendar)</small> If it's still not working, reach out to us <a href="{{ env('APP_DISCORD') }}" target="_blank">on our Discord</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was chosen as the easiest possible solution for solving the problem of scheduling raids and events in a guild. Many guilds already use Google Sheets to manage a lot of information, and so it wasn't much of a stretch for those guilds to use Google Calendar amongst their officers as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why didn't we implement our own calendar? Calendars, timezones, and time tracking are immensely complicated concepts in programming. Implementing our own calendar may take several more times more work than the rest of this website combined. For more information, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5wpm-gesOY" target="_blank">this video</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Don't like Google Calendar? If you have a good suggestion for another calendar for us to support, let us know <a href="{{ env('APP_DISCORD') }}" target="_blank">on our Discord</a> and we'll have a look.

            <p>
                It's an ongoing meme (and reality) that many players and classes in World of Warcraft Classic will attempt to claim pretty much every item as their Best in Slot ("That's my BIS"). We thought it sounded like an appropriate name for this website, as we've literally designed it to help raiders tell their loot council "Hey, that's my BIS, give it here."
            </p>
            <p>
                Someone even made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lCC3r-Bxzk" target="_blank">tasteful little song</a> about this meme.

                Maybe. Let us know <a href="{{ env('APP_DISCORD') }}" target="_blank">on our Discord</a> what you'd like to see, and we'll see if we can add it. Almost all <a href="https://github.com/thatsmybis/thatsmybis/projects/1" target="_blank">features added</a> post-launch have come from user requests.
